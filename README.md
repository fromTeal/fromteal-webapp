## Why
Help people work on what they love, love their work & make a living out of it.

## What
FromTeal is an app that helps people who have ideas for projects *team-up* with other people who share the same passion & purpose, so they can work on these projects together & make them a reality. 
However, we realize that teaming-up is just the first step, and in order for these teams to succeed, they need to be able to work together happily as equal partners. For example, everyone should have the power to make decisions without anyone telling others what to do, they should have the tools for resolving conflicts & they need a way to fairly distribute the value created by the project. This is why the app is also helping people *teal-up* - become a Teal organization, i.e., self-managed, purpose-driven & wholeness-cherishing (as described in the book “Reinventing Organizations”, by Fred Laloux).
